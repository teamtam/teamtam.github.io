After recently doing a clean up of my study, I re-discovered a bunch of my old technical books. Exciting, riveting, blog-worthy stuff I know! ðŸ˜› So, I thought I would indulge in a few quick minutes to reflect before they hit the recycle bin. These timeless classics included:

  * Various early versions/editions of &#8220;Java in a Nutshell&#8221;. My first job in the industry was as a Java developer, which I managed to get while I was still at uni. It was such a blessing and I don&#8217;t think I realised how much so at the time &#8211; thank you to Peter Moore, Tim Jordan and the crew at Cortex eBusiness for the opportunity! In hindsight, it was such an exciting time in the industry riding the dot-com boom and bust, working on Australia&#8217;s leading e-commerce projects and the bleeding edge technologies of the time. I do miss the energy of a start-up.

  * The Python, Perl, Linux and general web titles reflected my desire to improve in the LAMP technology stack many moons ago. I still dabble in Python from time to time, usually for odd jobs on personal projects. Later on, I ended up doing 1-2 years of Perl, although not necessarily by choice &#8230; it wasn&#8217;t that bad in the midst of doing it, but I don&#8217;t think I remember or could even read much of it now! I can still get by with Linux, but tinkering with the OSX terminal occasionally is about as much as I do these days.

  * Please don&#8217;t mistake me for being a Photoshop or design whiz seeing &#8220;Photoshop in a Nutshell&#8221; there! I think it was for Photoshop 5 or something and was one of the more pristine books in the &#8220;recycle bin collection&#8221;.

  * SQL Server 2000 and Active Directory 2000 &#8220;Black Books&#8221;. In the&nbsp;early years at my previous organisation, I was a jack-of-all-trades while the IT department was getting established, and thus as part of this&nbsp;ill-defined role I performed some DBA and network admin duties. I have always enjoyed working with databases, and even tutored the subject at uni. I still have much respect for the SQL Server product and think it&#8217;s one of Microsoft&#8217;s better offerings, and thanks to Readify&#8217;s fantastic professional development program, I am planning on finally obtaining my MCDBA next financial year (doing my MCSD at the moment). And while I don&#8217;t really enjoy doing network support, the hands on time with Active Directory has proven to be a solid foundation for me as a developer now focused in the Microsoft space.

  * Don&#8217;t know how on earth I ended up with a &#8220;Visual Basic Controls&#8221; book!!! I had&nbsp;managed to avoid VB until very recently when I had to work on some legacy code at a bank.

Now, time to join the 21st century and unwrap my Kindle!
