As part of studying for my Xamarin Certification, I wanted some extra practice before sitting the exam. As such, I decided to do a Xamarin iOS and Android version of the same Xamarin.Forms timesheet app I implemented and wrote about before. The added bonus of this is that it could potentially provide a basis of comparison between &#8216;vanilla&#8217; Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms. So in case it helps anybody, I have made the source code available on GitHub.

**Exam Update**

I subsequently passed the exam &#8230; I am now <del>certifiable</del> certified! ðŸ™‚ That will most definitely do me for a while in terms of exams and certifications, having notched up my MSCD, PSM I and now Xamarin in the past 6 months. I&#8217;ve enjoyed the process and they were all valuable experiences, but for now it is time for me to get my hands &#8216;dirty&#8217;!
