  As of today, I am no longer on probation at Readify. <em>Happy days!!!</em> With this milestone, I wanted to take a few moments to reflect and share my experience of the first six months in the business.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Going into Readify I knew I would be surrounded by brilliant minds, but I didn&#8217;t realise how good it would be to learn and work alongside them. At first it was such a challenge to not be intimidated but I could see the continual opportunities for growth. While I hadn&#8217;t previously given much credence to certifications or even MVPs, of which there are an extraordinary number of at Readify, I quickly changed my opinion after seeing them operate. It has certainly inspired me to work on the depth and breadth of my own technical knowledge. As such I have committed myself to obtaining a number of certifications that interest me, starting with a MCSD in Web Applications. Fortunately, the company has good provisions for professional development to support this.

  While the team all know their stuff technically, what differentiates Readify from many other technology companies is the emphasis on leadership, teamwork, influencing and soft skills. I have previously been in environments with many incredibly smart people and have also been in environments with many influential and charismatic leaders. However, it is certainly rare to have so many technologists who are articulate, influential and also enjoyable to have a few drinks with! I have particularly enjoyed working with the Principal Consultants. It is obvious almost immediately why they are where they are, as they can always seemingly communicate ideas quickly, readily and convincingly with only a few short sentences.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Another observation which I believe separates Readify from other organisations I have worked for is their desire to promote on merit. In the past, I have felt that often the wrong people get recognised by seemingly only using their social or political skills to climb the corporate ladder. While building trust and camaraderie with your team will never go astray, the emphasis at Readify does appear to be actual job performance. More importantly for myself however, while I may not currently be a Principal Consultant, I am encouraged to be as good as I can be and am consistently empowered, supported and shown how to improve. Other organisations I have been at expect the best people, but with no idea how to *<em>produce</em>* the best people. At Readify though it seems the main ceiling is myself and how much effort I am willing to invest to mastering all aspects my craft.

  Finally, the company&#8217;s annual kick-off was certainly an eye opener and highlight for me, which was held soon after I started. What I now remember most vividly after several months was how executives admitted mistakes and addressed how they would rectify them. This was done openly on stage with little sugar-coating. In my experience, management tended to not admit mistakes until it was too late with half of the company suddenly retrenched. Alternatively, mistakes were swept under the carpet and never talked about. Since kick-off, I have seen management continually ask for feedback from the entire company and then diligently attempt to follow through to make it a stronger organisation and a better place to work. The results may not always please everybody, especially with such a diverse and intelligent crew with strong opinions, but it is definitely not for a lack of effort or desire. I remain impressed by the genuine and transparent way in which management conduct themselves.

  Overall after six months, I am certainly enjoying the challenge, culture and the environment that Readify provide. With the benefit of hindsight, of the opportunities that presented themselves to me at the time, I have no doubt I made the right choice with Readify! It has been a long time since I genuinely looked forward to coming to work each morning.
