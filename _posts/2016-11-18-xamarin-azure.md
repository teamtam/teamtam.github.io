Earlier this week, I gave a presentation at the [Brisbane .NET User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Net-User-Group/)

The talk was focused on the integration story between Xamarin and Azure, with a deeper look at the Offline Data Sync feature. The value that Azure provides for mobile apps is really good these days, and is ever evolving and improving like everything with Azure. While I used Xamarin.Forms as a convenient example during the presentation, Azure's support for mobility is not just for Xamarin, but also for native iOS, Android, Windows or Cordova-based apps. This of course reflects Microsoft's recent philosophy of platform agnosticism.
